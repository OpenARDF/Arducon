# Arducon
Arducon is a transmitter controller for Amateur Radio Direction Finding (ARDF). The project is based on the Arduino Pro Mini, and it includes everything needed to create printed circuit boards and executable software. A complete Bill of Material (BOM) is provided to assist with ordering all the parts you'll need.

<b>KiCad</b>

The KiCad folder holds files for generating the schematic, BOM, and PCB files using KiCad. On an OS X system the kicad directory should be placed in ~/Documents/GitHub/Arducon.

<b>Software</b>

The Software folder holds files for compiling executable code using either the Arduino IDE or Atmel Studio 7. The latter provides better debugging tools. Both IDEs will build the same functional executable code for flashing into an Arduino Pro Mini.
