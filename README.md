# Arducon
A transmitter controller for Amateur Radio Direction Finding (ARDF) based on the Arduino Pro Mini.

<b>KiCad</b>

The kicad folder holds files for generating the schematic, BOM, and PCB files using KiCad. On an OS X system the kicad directory should be placed in ~/Documents/GitHub/Arducon.

<b>Software</b>

The Software folder holds files for compiling executable code using either the Arduino IDE or Atmel Studio 7. The latter provides better debugging tools. Both IDEs will build the same functional executable code for flashing into an Arduino Pro Mini.
